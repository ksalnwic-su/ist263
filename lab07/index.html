        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Katherine Alnwick and I am currently studying <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong> in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University. More specifically, I am concentrating on Project Management as I am interested in working with peers to successfully complete tasks to help a company advance. My accomplishments and skills are making the Dean’s List consistently, Honor Society, and my organizational and communication skills. I am a sister of two brothers, one older and one younger. I’m a daughter to my mom and dad who raised me on Long Island, New York where I grew a love for warm weather and the beach. Additionally, I grew up skiing almost every single weekend, so have a natural pull to the mountains. I have two dogs, a Golden Retriever, and a mix of a Golden Retriever and Lab who I absolutely love!
