    <h5>My Background of Analytics</h5>
    <p>I actually picked these techniques up through a class I took Junior year at Syracuse University called "IST 486", with the proper name of Social Media within the Organization. I learned a lot and actually had to make my own campaign for a project and view the insights off of that. It was very interesting to me so I actually look on Instagram now to see insights and interactions.</p>

    <h6>How I did it</h6>
    <p> I was able to implement a social media metrics model while enhancing exposure and reaching new target audiences. Additionally, I analyzed key performance indicators, insights, reactions, and engagement data sets to then strategize using a data driven approach. </p>
    
    <p>This data analysis and interpretation allowed me to organize statistics to better serve the customers. I began the account with the baseline of all workers, which was approximately 60 followers. As I worked to broaden my reach throughout the summer, I concluded my role with 1,900 followers. </p>
    
    <p>I took the responsibility very seriously and constantly implemented different marketing techniques to attract a broader range of customers. As a result, there was an 80% growth in my likes and interactions with posts from May to August. Along with managing the social media accounts, I was able to perform website testing utilizing my coding languages (Python, SQL, and HTML) which helped me to succeed quickly and effectively.  </p>
