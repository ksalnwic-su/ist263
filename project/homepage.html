        <p>Hello! My name is Katherine Alnwick. I am originally from Long Island, New York, but currently live in Syracuse, NY where I am a student at Syracuse University. As I'm graduating in May, and have been going through the job application process. I would like to show a little bit about what I did when I worked remotely for L'Oreal as a Brand Ambassador.

        <h5>Traveling</h5>
        <p>Other than my Personal and Professional Achievements, I like to challenge myself, do things others may not do, and be excellent at the ones I choose to do. Out of the workplace, I am drawn to exhilarating activities. Last Spring while studying abroad in Australia, not only did I skydive and cageless shark dive, I navigated my way through a country I had no prior knowledge of.</p>

        <h6>Dogs</h6>
        <p>I also have two dogs, one is a Golden Retriever who we named Bubba, and the other is a mix of a Yellow Lab and Golden Retriever. Her name is Blu. I've had dogs my whole life, so living at school without them is so sad especially leaving them.</p>
