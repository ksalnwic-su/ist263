    <header>What I Learned</header>
    <h1>Greatest Take-Aways</h1>
    <p>This experience has taught me a lot about the beauty industry, the skills necessary, and myself in general. I was able to see how the tactics used when Marketing need to be extremely adaptable and adjustable based off of the personality along with age of your targeted consumer. I learned that marketing and advertising are so important because connection and appeal to clients is crucial. Clients are the ins and outs of every business and ultimately what keeps them afloat.</p>

    <h2>Who I've Become</h2>
    <p>I would say that through this experience, I became a person with a reputation as a very reliable, hard worker. I took it as a huge accomplishment that my friends mom, after only meeting her once, asked me out of everyone to help her with her business and responsibilities. I also had the opportunity to learn and direct myself to where I see myself best fit in the future. Being abroad made me realize the opportunities I could have working globally for a huge company like L’Oreal. I also have a knack for marketing and see myself as a leader who others would appreciate learning from.
    </p>

    <h3>Where this will take me</h3>
    <p>I think other than the personal impact of this responsibility, it also had a very professional impact as well. I had never previously marketed online like that and came up with my own photos to help promote the line. It allowed me to see that marketing side and use my creativity and determine if I really thoroughly enjoyed it and if I would like to take that somewhere into my future. I learned how the beauty industry is timeless and constantly changing and growing. That being said, emerging products are continuously introduced and therefore, need to be advertised, launched, and catered to. The beauty industries main focus needs to be on sustainability and diversity within the company along with the ability to constantly adapt to the market and trends that are socially recognized.

    <h4>Major Professional Goals</h4>
    <p>One day I really would love to work within the Marketing department of a company within the Beauty Industry, specifically L'Oreal. i think the greatest reward would be greating something,whether that be an advertisement, a commercial, or even adesign on a product package, and then seeing that on a big billboard or in a store</p>

    <h5>My Values & the Values I look for within a Company</h5>
    <p>I would say the values I look for within a company are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>High Energy, Comfortable Work Culture</li>
        <li>Opportunities for Career Growth</li>
        <li>Respect from CoWorkers</li>
        <li>Supportive Environment</li>
    </ol>
    <p>L'Oreal follows 6 core values in which I will dive deeper into!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Passion</li>
        <li>Innovation</li>
        <li>Entrepreneurial Spirit</li>
        <li>Open-Mindedness</li>
        <li>Quest for Excellence</li>
        <li>Responsibility</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I am very interested in the Marketing department, Managing department, and emerging markets team. I think I could be such a great fit because I am very well-rounded which would allow me to bring something unique to the table.  I maintain a positive attitude, I am extremely hard working, and I know how to be a strong team player. It is my understanding that L’Oreal values teamwork as it is a significant part of its culture, and I pride myself on being a strong team player.</p>
